A python script to explore the solutions space of the ThirtySix android game

In these days I was wasting my time playing ThirtySix, a game consisting into
fill a grid with 36 consecutive numbers (more details on the 
[google play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stranigiorni.thirtysixx)).

Since I have other means of wasting my time, not necessarily smarter than
playing ThirtySix, I've wrote a python script for solving the game on my
behalf.

It is just a simple exercise. Fork and enjoy if you feel so.
